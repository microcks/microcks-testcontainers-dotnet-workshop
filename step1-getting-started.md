# Step 1: Getting Started

Before getting started, let's make sure you have everything you need for running this demo.

You'll need the latest .NET SDK for this workshop. Testcontainers libraries are compatible with .NET, and this workshop uses an ASP.NET Core application.

We recommend downloading the latest .NET SDK from the [official .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

### Install Docker
You need to have a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) environment to use Testcontainers.
